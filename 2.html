  The Okęcie Airport incident was a dispute between the players and staff
   of the Poland national football team on 29 November 1980,
   climaxing at Okęcie Airport (pictured). It occurred at a time when civil
   resistance was intensifying in communist Poland and led to the suspension
   of several prominent players and the resignation of the team manager,
    Ryszard Kulesza. Kulesza had initially angered the team by deciding to
    prevent a hung-over player, Józef Młynarczyk,
  from flying with the team, but eventually relented. Polish media
   attacked the rebellious players over the following days. Another player,
Stanisław Terlecki, defied the communist authorities by arranging for
the players to meet Pope John Paul II. The Polish Football Association
sent Terlecki and others home and imposed various bans. Kulesza resigned
in protest over the harshness of the sanctions imposed on the players.
Most of the banned players were reinstated within a year, but Terlecki
never played for Poland again.
